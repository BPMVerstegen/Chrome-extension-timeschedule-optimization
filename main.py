```

Note that this code assumes you have replaced "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" and "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" with your actual Google Client ID and Client Secret. This code should be run in the background to sync the events with the Google Calendar API.

This Python script will continuously poll the Google Calendar API for updates to the events and display them in the console. The `ScheduleMaster` class encapsulates the logic for synchronizing events and updating the display.

Please note that this script will continuously run until it is manually stopped. If you want it to run in the background without starting a new console window, you may need to consider using a more advanced scheduling mechanism or a tool like systemd to manage the script.

To integrate this script with the existing directory structure, you would need to delete the contents of the `background.ts` and `content.ts` files, as well as the `popup.js` file. Then, you would need to convert the above Python script into a set of files that match the existing directory structure.

Here's the new directory structure with the necessary modifications:

- `background.py`: The modified version of the existing `background.ts` file.
- `content.py`: The modified version of the existing `content.ts` file.
- `implementations.py`: The modified version of the existing `implementations.ts` file.
- `popup.html`: The modified version of the existing `popup.html` file.
- `popup.py`: The new `popup.py` file that contains the modified JavaScript code for the popup.
- `manifest.json`: The modified version of the existing `manifest.json` file.

Please note that you will need to update the `background.py` and `content.py` files to match the new Python implementation. The other files (`implementations.py`, `popup.html`, `popup.py`, and `manifest.json`) will remain the same.

Also, note that the `puppeteer` package is not actually necessary in this Python version of your application, because the modification of HTML files or web pages is more easily solved by managing web pages as strings or, if you can use some kind of browser controls built into the browser types like selenium.

After running `yarn start` to start your llama development server, run the Python script using Python, for example, like so:

```bash
python background.py
```
